Most cameras today can't detect proper exposure through the ND filter so the process to take a photo with a ND filter is (Nikon camera example):

1. Switch to M mode (or S)
2. Find proper exposure without the filter
3. Put the filter on
4. Dial shutter speed to the value ND Filter tells you
5. Take a shot!

The formula we use to calculate the values is Tnd = T0 * 2^nd, where Tnd is shutter speed with the filter, T0 is shutter speed without the filter and nd is filter density (1, 2, 3, ... 13).
